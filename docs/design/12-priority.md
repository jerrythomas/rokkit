## P1 — High Impact, Core Functionality

Items that block other work or are essential for the library to be complete.

### Restore Deleted Components

These components existed and were deleted in commit `4ef37ef4` (2026-02-18). Source and tests survive in git history. Placeholder stories exist in `site/src/stories/`.

- [x] **StatusList** (`@rokkit/ui`) — list of status checks (pass/fail/warn/unknown) with icons, used for multi-rule validation like password strength. Theme CSS, playground, docs, and e2e tests complete (2026-03-18).
- [x] **Message/Alert** (`@rokkit/ui`) — single alert/notification with `type` (error/info/success/warning) and text or snippet children, plus `AlertList` toast system using `@rokkit/states` alerts store. Playground, docs, and e2e tests complete (2026-03-18).

### Forms

- [x] Conditional fields — `showWhen` on layout elements, `equals`/`notEquals` operators, `getVisibleData()` on submit (`docs/features/05-Forms.md`)
- [ ] Multi-step forms — sequential steps with per-step validation and step indicator (`docs/features/05-Forms.md`)

### Component Library

- [x] Rename `text` field to `label` in all component defaults and remove backward compatibility layer (code change)
- [x] Cards — implemented (`packages/ui/src/components/Card.svelte`)
- [x] Navigation: Breadcrumb — implemented (`packages/ui/src/components/BreadCrumbs.svelte`)
- [ ] Layout components — Stack and Divider missing; Grid exists (`docs/features/06-ComponentLibrary.md`)
- [ ] Data Table — tabular data display with sorting, selection, and keyboard navigation (`docs/features/06-ComponentLibrary.md`)

### Theming & Design

- [ ] Data-density controls — compact / default / comfortable density modes inherited from context (`docs/features/03-ThemingAndDesign.md`)
- [ ] Whitelabeling — full replacement of all visual defaults via skin + typography + icon + shape tokens (`docs/features/03-ThemingAndDesign.md`)

---

## P2 — User Experience Enhancements

Items that significantly improve the developer or end-user experience.

### Accessibility & Internationalization

- [ ] Tooltips — hover and focus triggered, keyboard accessible, linked via aria-describedby (`docs/features/04-AccessibilityAndI18n.md`)
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) — translatable built-in strings, locale-aware number/date formatting, RTL layout support (`docs/features/04-AccessibilityAndI18n.md`)

### Developer Utilities

- [ ] Custom component primitives — documented patterns and examples for building components on top of controllers, navigator, and ProxyItem (`docs/features/08-DeveloperUtilities.md`)

### Charts — Core Functionality

- [ ] Sparkline pattern fills — pattern fill alternative for color-insufficient contexts (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Animated bar chart — animated entry and data transition (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Animated line / area chart — line draw animation and smooth data transitions (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Pie / donut chart — proportional segment chart with optional center label (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Theme color palette integration — charts draw series colors from active theme skin (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Dark mode support for charts — background, gridlines, labels, and series adapt to dark mode (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Accessible data table fallback — visually hidden data table in DOM for screen reader access (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [x] BoxPlot — quartile aggregation via `@rokkit/data`, `fill` (body) + `color` (whiskers) aesthetics (2026-03-23)
- [x] ViolinPlot — density shape via quartile anchors + catmullRom curve, `fill` + `color` aesthetics (2026-03-23)
- [x] BubbleChart — scatter with `size` channel, `color` aesthetic, sizeScale sqrt encoding (2026-03-23)
- [x] ggplot2-style aesthetic channels — `fill` for polygons, `color` for strokes/lines, all channels null-default independent (2026-03-23)
- [ ] Horizontal BarChart — `orientation='horizontal'` flips x/y axes (issue #108)
- [ ] Stacked / grouped BarChart — `stack` and `group` layout modes (issue #109)
- [ ] Static color literal support — `fill`/`color` accepts CSS color values directly without groupBy (issue #110)

## P3 — Advanced Features

Items that add sophisticated capabilities.

### Charts — Advanced Interaction

- [ ] Interactive tooltips — value and label tooltip on hover over data points and bars (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Click selection on data points — selection event fires with point data on click (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation within charts — focus moves between data points, values announced to screen readers (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Scatter chart — x/y correlation plot with optional size and color encoding (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Pattern fills for series — stripe, dot, and hatch patterns for multi-series differentiation (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)
- [ ] Zoom and pan — scrollable and draggable chart viewport for large data ranges (`docs/features/07-Charts.md`)

### Toolchain

- [ ] CLI: add Rokkit to a project — installs packages, configures build, imports starter theme (`docs/features/09-Toolchain.md`)
- [x] CLI: upgrade Rokkit — `rokkit upgrade` detects @rokkit/* deps, fetches latest versions, prints diff, detects package manager, runs install with `--apply` (2026-03-18)
- [ ] Curated icon sets — navigation, status, action, and object icons with tree-shaking (`docs/features/09-Toolchain.md`)
- [ ] Tree-shaken icon imports — only imported icons included in the bundle (`docs/features/09-Toolchain.md`)
- [ ] Custom icon override (global snippet) — replace all component icons with any icon system via one registration point (`docs/features/09-Toolchain.md`)
- [x] CLI: generate custom skin — `rokkit skin create --name` scaffolds skin entry with all 9 color token keys in rokkit.config.js (2026-03-18)
- [x] CLI: generate custom theme scaffold — `rokkit theme create --name` generates CSS stub with all 25 component selectors in src/themes/ (2026-03-18)
