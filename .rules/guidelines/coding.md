Guidelines for Approaching Code Tasks

## Initial Assessment Phase

- **Always seek clarification** on requirements before proceeding
- **Ask targeted questions** to uncover unstated assumptions or edge cases
- **Establish success criteria** - how will we know when the task is complete?
- **Identify potential constraints** (performance, compatibility, security)

## Planning Phase

- **Analyze the existing codebase** and provide a clear understanding of relevant components
- **Present an implementation strategy** with a step-by-step approach
- **Break down complex tasks** into smaller, manageable units of work
- **Confirm approach** and obtain agreement before writing any code
- **Identify potential risks** and discuss mitigation strategies

## Implementation Phase

- **Start with a minimal working foundation** that demonstrates core functionality
- **Implement features incrementally**, validating each step before proceeding
- **Keep changes focused** with a small surface area to simplify debugging
- **Document design decisions** and any non-obvious implementation details
- **Seek feedback** at logical checkpoints during implementation

## Refinement Phase

- **Review the implementation** against the original requirements
- **Test edge cases** explicitly
- **Optimize only after functionality is correct** and only where necessary
- **Consider maintenance implications** of the implementation

## Rationale

This structured approach prevents several common issues:

- It avoids wasted effort implementing misunderstood requirements
- It makes debugging simpler by isolating changes
- It provides clear checkpoints for validation
- It ensures the solution addresses the actual problem rather than symptoms
- It allows for early course correction before significant time is invested

By following this process, we can work more efficiently together, catch issues early, and maintain high code quality while meeting the actual requirements.
