## What is rokkit?

Rokkit is a powerful UI library that combines the power of Svelte's component architecture with the flexibility of UnoCSS's utility class-based design system. This allows you to quickly and easily customize and extend the appearance of each component, creating customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces for any size project. The combination of Svelte and UnoCSS makes it easy to build beautiful and intuitive interfaces with Rokkit.
