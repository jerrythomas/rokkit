## {title}

Here's another example that uses an array of objects. The list uses the Text component to render items. The List expects a `text` attribute on each item. Optionally an `image` or `icon` attribute can be provided for each item.

In this example, the value attribute has been included. Click on any item in the list to see the data
of the selected item.

## Properties

- _items_ : Supply the data for the list
- _fields_ : Adapt to your data by customizing the fields
- _using_ : An object containing components to be used for displaying data. Uses the Text component by default.
- _value_ : Current selected value of the list
- _class_ : Set custom class for style overrides
