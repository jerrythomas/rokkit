## {title}

Here's another example which uses an array of objects. List uses the Text component to render items.
List expects `text` attribute on each item. Optionally an `image` or `icon` attributes can be provided
for each item.

In this example, the value attribute has been included. Click on any item in the list to see the data
of the selected item.

## Properties

- _items_ : Supply the data for the list.
- _mapping_ : Adapt to your data by providing a custom field mapping. The mapping also includes an option to set the default component to be used
- _value_ : Current selected value of the list
- _class_ : Set custom class for style overrides
