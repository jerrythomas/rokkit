In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use the `Tabs` component to create a dynamic and responsive tabbed interface. You'll be able to customize the position of the tabs by toggling the `below` property between true and false. By default, the tabs will be displayed above the content, but by setting the `below` property to true, you can move them below the content.

Additionally, you can control the alignment of the tabs using the `align` property. You can choose between 'left', 'center', and 'right' alignments, with the default being 'left'. With these customizable properties, you can create a tabbed interface tailored to your specific design requirements and improve the user experience of your application.

On the preview, you will notice two controls that allow you to modify these properties easily.

- The first control is a switch that enables you to toggle the `below` property between true and false, thereby changing the position of the tabs above or below the content.
- The second control is a toggle that lets you switch between the 'left', 'center', and 'right' alignments for the tabs by changing the `align` property.

Go ahead and experiment with these controls to see how the appearance of the `Tabs` component changes in real-time. By adjusting these properties, you can get a feel for the versatility and flexibility of the `Tabs` component and understand how it can be adapted to fit various design requirements.
