Tabs are similar to lists. They are primarily used for switching between different views.
It is laid out horizontally, so it is recommended to use a smaller number of tabs.
Using a large number will result in scrollable tabs which may not be user-friendly.

Some of the notable features of this component are:

- Get started with a simple string array
- Attributes like text, icon/images or URLs can be mapped to attributes in the data
- Default item components like Text & Link are available, however, custom components can also be used
- It is also possible to configure a different component to be used for different items based on an
  attribute in the data.
