The Switch component provides a flexible and customizable way to create Switch switches with multiple items. With different props and customization options, you can create a wide variety of Switch switches to suit your application's needs.

It is laid out horizontally, so it works better with a smaller number of items.

Let's start with a basic example.

```svelte
<script>
	import { Switch } from '@rokkit/core'
</script>

<Switch />
```

By default, the Switch component will have two items representing false and true.
