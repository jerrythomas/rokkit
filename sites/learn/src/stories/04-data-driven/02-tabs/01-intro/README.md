The Tabs component is a highly extensible and versatile UI element that simplifies navigation within your application. Like the Toggle component, Tabs shares similar features such as the ability to define custom items, map fields, and provide custom components through the using property.

This allows for seamless integration and customization to match your application's theme and requirements. With the Tabs component, you can effortlessly create interactive and dynamic navigation experiences, while maintaining the flexibility to extend the component's functionality as needed. Harness the power and extensibility of the Tabs component to elevate your application's user interface and improve overall usability.

The Tabs component is designed with a horizontal layout, making it more suitable for a limited number of tabs. Including an excessive number of tabs may lead to a scrollable interface, which could negatively impact user-friendliness. Therefore, it's advisable to keep the number of tabs to a minimum for an optimal user experience.

Some of the notable features of this component are:

- Get started with a simple string array
- Attributes like text, icon/images or URLs can be mapped to attributes in the data
- Default item components like Text & Link are available, however, custom components can also be used
- It is also possible to configure a different component to be used for different items based on an
  attribute in the data.
