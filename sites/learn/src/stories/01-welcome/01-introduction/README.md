Welcome to the Rokkit tutorial! This will teach you everything you need to know to simplify your workflow of building data-driven web applications.

## What is Rokkit?

Rokkit is a cutting-edge Svelte UI library designed to simplify the way we create data-driven applications. With its intuitive design and an extensive collection of actions, stores, utility functions, and composable components, Rokkit empowers developers to create stunning user interfaces with unmatched ease and flexibility.

The library includes:

- Data-Driven Components
- Form Elements & Generators
- Grouped Components
- Composable components
- Actions
- Stores
- Useful Utility Functions

At the heart of Rokkit's design is a commitment to consistency and ease of use. We wanted to make it easier to use components and extend them if needed to achieve the application objectives.

## Why Rokkit?

The following are some key challenges developers encounter when building applications that interact with APIs for data retrieval and storage:

- Developers tasked with user interface (UI) development need to convert data obtained from APIs into formats compatible with their components.
- Creating composable components demands additional coding efforts from developers, especially when implementing common elements such as lists.
- Numerous high-quality libraries are accessible, but they might not align with the application's theme or may be challenging to modify to match the theme and color scheme.
- Icons incorporated in external libraries may not be consistent with the application's icons.
- Components often lack extensibility, limiting their ability to address requirements beyond their out-of-the-box capabilities.

## How Rokkit Addresses These Challenges

Rokkit effectively addresses these challenges by providing the following solutions:

- Efficient Data Transformation: Rokkit streamlines the conversion of data from APIs into structures compatible with components, allowing UI developers to concentrate on other aspects of the application.
- Improved Component Reusability: Rokkit enables developers to utilize data-driven components, reducing the need for custom components and enhancing the efficiency of the development process.
- Flexible Library Integration: By default, Rokkit's components are unstyled. A collection of pre-built themes is available for use as a foundation, which can be extended to align with the application's theme and color scheme.
- Unified Iconography: Rokkit employs UnoCSS for icons, offering a predefined set of customizable icons. Alternative icons can be supplied for the aliases used, and icons can be passed as parameters to components for further customization. This approach ensures consistency between the application's icons and those in the components.
- Adaptable Components: Rokkit's components are designed with extensibility in mind, empowering developers to address a wide range of application requirements without being constrained by the limitations of standard components.
