Patterns are visual elements used in charts and visualizations to enhance accessibility by providing alternative representations of data or information. They serve as an additional layer of communication for users with different needs or preferences, allowing them to interpret charts more effectively. Patterns are particularly useful for individuals who may have difficulty distinguishing between colors or who rely on screen readers.

## Pattern Component

The Pattern component is a valuable feature in charting libraries that enables the creation and application of patterns to chart elements. It supports various types of patterns, such as stripes, dots, or custom designs, and provides options for customization, including:

- __name__: Specifies the type of pattern to be applied, such as stripes or dots.
- __size__: Determines the size or spacing of the pattern elements, defaults to 10
- __fill__: Specifies the fill color of the pattern elements.
- __stroke__: Specifies the fill color of the pattern elements.

### Benefits for Accessibility

Patterns offer several benefits for accessibility in charts:

1. __Enhanced Contrast__: By using patterns in addition to colors, charts become more accessible to users who may have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. The patterns provide an additional visual cue that improves the contrast between different data elements.

2. __Alternative Representation__: Patterns serve as an alternative representation of data, especially for users who rely on screen readers or have color vision deficiencies. They convey information through tactile or visual means, allowing users to interpret charts more accurately.

3. __Clearer Communication__: Patterns help convey complex information more clearly by providing visual differentiation between data categories or groups. This clarity aids all users in understanding the chart's content and relationships.

In the example, DefinePatterns defines all patterns and we display all the patterns using a rectangle..
